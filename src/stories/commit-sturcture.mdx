# Spesification

For this project, we will using [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

For example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(feature-name): allow provided message to describe feature release"
```

Commit message with ! to draw attention to breaking change

```bash
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

The commit types are used to categorize the changes made in a commit. They help to understand the nature of the changes and their impact on the codebase. Here is a brief description of each commit type:

-   build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
-   chore: Changes that donâ€™t modify source or test files. Examples include changes to the build process, auxiliary tools, and libraries.
-   ci: Changes to the continuous integration (CI) configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
-   docs: Documentation only changes.
-   feat: A new feature.
-   fix: A bug fix.
-   perf: A code change that improves performance.
-   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
-   revert: Reverts a previous commit.
-   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
-   test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
-   translation: Changes related to translation.
-   security: Changes related to security.
-   changeset: Changes related to changeset.

These commit types are used in conventional commits, which is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. By following this specification, it becomes easier to understand the purpose of each commit and to generate changelogs automatically.
